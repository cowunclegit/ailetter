# AILetter Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Tech Stack
The project frontend MUST use React.js and the backend MUST use Node.js. This stack is verified and non-negotiable for core application components to ensure consistency and maintainability.

### II. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All features MUST have tests written first. Every feature addition or code change MUST pass all tests before acceptance. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is mandatory.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
Code should be clean, readable, and maintainable. Adhere to standard linting and formatting rules for the respective technologies (React/Node).

## Governance

All code changes must verify compliance with the Tech Stack and TDD principles. Complexity must be justified. Amendments to this constitution require a version bump and updates to dependent templates.
